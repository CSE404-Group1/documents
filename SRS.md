### 2.2
## Product Features

*<Summarize the major functions the product must perform or must let the user perform. Details will be provided in Section 3, so only a high level summary (such as a bullet list) is needed here. Organize the functions to make them understandable to any reader of the SRS. A picture of the major groups of related requirements and how they relate, such as a top level data flow diagram or object class diagram, is often effective.>*

### 2.3
## User Classes and Characteristics

The users of the program will be able to view a product of his/her choice by selecting a category or he/she can roam around the homepage for the availabality  of the products on sale . afterwards he/she has to travel to the specific store to retain the offer .

In order to post the products the seller has to verify his id by logging in the website . The seller needs to provide the information of the product as instructed. The seller has to accomplish the following activities :

**Add a product**

-Name

-Id

-Description

-Actual price

-Discounted price

-Offer start date

-Offer end date

-Quantity

-Seller id

-Brand name

**The administrations have the authority to perform this functionalities over the users as a last resort.**

*Review

*Add

*Delete

### 2.4
## Operating Environment

The operating environment for Komekinun is as follows :-

*Operating system*- all os

*Database*-mysql

*Platform*-laravel/angular (5)

### 2.5 
## Design and Implementation Constraints

*<Describe any items or issues that will limit the options available to the developers. These might include: corporate or regulatory policies; hardware limitations (timing requirements, memory requirements); interfaces to other applications; specific technologies, tools, and databases to be used; parallel operations; language requirements; communications protocols; security considerations; design conventions or programming standards (for example, if the customerâ€™s organization will be responsible for maintaining the delivered software).>*

### 2.6
## Assumptions and Dependencies

**We have taken three probable dependencies into action that may arise during operations.**

 - A seller may post on invalid product . In that case the super admin can claim for a review and delete it after proper justification.
 - The super admin can delete a valid product from the website if the product finishes from the stock even before its validity period comes to an end.
 - A seller posting repeated fake products will be banned from posting further after it has been checked by the super admin.
