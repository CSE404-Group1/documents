# Overall Description
_____

### 2.1	
## Product Perspective

**Seller details:** It includes the seller name, seller id, contact number, e-mail id etc. as it will be more trust worthy and convenient to the buyers.

**Customer details:** The customer name, contact number and e-mail id have been included as the customer information.

**Product details:** komEkinun has the products classified into various segments including Men's and Women's fashion, computing and gaming, beauty and health, foods etc. A particular product within a classified segment includes the product name, product id, actual price, sale price, validity date etc.

### 2.2
## Product Features


*<Summarize the major functions the product must perform or must let the user perform. Details will be provided in Section 3, so only a high level summary (such as a bullet list) is needed here. Organize the functions to make them understandable to any reader of the SRS. A picture of the major groups of related requirements and how they relate, such as a top level data flow diagram or object class diagram, is often effective.>*

### 2.3
## User Classes and Characteristics

The users of the program will be able to view a product of his/her choice by selecting a category or he/she can roam around the homepage for the availability of the products on sale. afterwards he/she must travel to the specific store to retain the offer.

To post the products, the seller must verify his id by logging in the website. The seller needs to provide the information of the product as instructed. The seller must accomplish the following activities:


**Add a product**

-Name

-Id

-Description

-Actual price

-Discounted price

-Offer start date

-Offer end date

-Quantity

-Seller id

-Brand name

**The administrations have the authority to perform this functionalities over the users as a last resort.**

*Review

*Add

*Delete

### 2.4
## Operating Environment

The operating environment for Komekinun is as follows: -

*Front end*-angular (5)

*Back end*-Laravel 5.5

*Database*-mysql


### 2.5 
## Design and Implementation Constraints

*<Describe any items or issues that will limit the options available to the developers. These might include: corporate or regulatory policies; hardware limitations (timing requirements, memory requirements); interfaces to other applications; specific technologies, tools, and databases to be used; parallel operations; language requirements; communications protocols; security considerations; design conventions or programming standards (for example, if the customerâ€™s organization will be responsible for maintaining the delivered software).>*

### 2.6
## Assumptions and Dependencies

**We have taken three probable dependencies into action that may arise during operations.**

 - A seller may post on invalid product . In that case the super admin can claim for a review and delete it after proper justification.
 
 - The super admin can delete a valid product from the website if the product finishes from the stock even before its validity period comes to an end.
 
 - A seller posting repeated fake products will be banned from posting further after it has been checked by the super admin.
